Q14
# Write Python code to print out how far light travels 
# in centimeters in one nanosecond.  Use the values
# defined below.    
speed_of_light = 299792458   #meters per second
centimeters = 100            #one meter is 100 centimeters
nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000  #one billionth of a second

distance = speed_of_light * centimeters * nanosecond
print distance 
print "centimeters"

output: 29.9792458


Q18 
# Given the variables defined here, write Python 
# code that prints out the distance, in meters, 
# that light travels in one processor cycle. 

# speed_of_light in meters per second
# cycles_per_second is 2.7 GHz

speed_of_light = 299792458.0 
cycles_per_second = 2700000000.0

distance = speed_of_light / cycles_per_second
print distance

Q21 ans error

Q22 # Write python code that defines the variable 
# age to be your age in years, and then prints 
# out the number of days you have been alive.

age = 23
days_in_year =365

age_in_days = age * days_in_year
print age_in_days

output: 8395

Q39 
# Write Python code that initializes the variable
# start_link to be the value of the position
# where the first '<a href=' occurs in a page.

page = '''<div id="top_bin"> <div id="top_content" class="width960">
   <div class="udacity float-left"> <a href="/">'''

start_link = page.find('<a href=')
#print start_link

Q40 
# Write Python code that assigns to the 
# variable url a string that is the value 
# of the first URL that appears in a link 
# tag in the string page.
# Your code should print http://udacity.com
# Make sure that if page were changed to

# page = '<a href="http://udacity.com">Hello world</a>'

# that your code still assigns the same value to the variable 'url', 
# and therefore still prints the same thing.

# page = contents of a web page
page =('<div id="top_bin"><div id="top_content" class="width960">'
'<div class="udacity float-left"><a href="http://udacity.com">')
start_link = page.find('<a href="')
#print start_link
end_link = page.find('">',start_link)
#print start_link
url = page[start_link+9:end_link]
print url
